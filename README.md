# **TaskFlow – Task Management Web Application**

## **Overview**
**TaskFlow** is a CRUD-based task management web application designed to help users organize and track their daily tasks efficiently. It provides a simple, clean, and intuitive interface where users can manage tasks with priority settings, due dates, and status tracking such as **Completed** or **Pending**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Since the backend is deployed on the free tier of Render, the server may take **up to 1 minute to wake up** after inactivity. Please wait patiently when testing the live app.
